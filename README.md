- 👀 I’m interested in creating meaningful applications that truly reach people and add to someone’s life. Whether its through important messaging or entertainment, I enjoy and am motivated by a user's positive experience with an application.  
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my portfolio, and a full stack application with a Django backend and React frontend focused on therapy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front end applications focused in React
